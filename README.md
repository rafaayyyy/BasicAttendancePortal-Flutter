# BasicAttendancePortalApplication-Flutter

This is a Flutter project that allows users to mark the attendance of
students using checkboxes. The app displays a list of students with
their roll numbers and names, and users can check or uncheck the
checkboxes next to each student to mark them as present or absent.

To submit the attendance, users can simply click on the \'Submit\'
button at the bottom of the screen. The app will then save the
attendance data and display a confirmation message.

Here\'s an overview of the key features of the Attendance Marking System
app:

-   Display a list of students with their roll numbers and names.

-   Count the number of students present and absent.
